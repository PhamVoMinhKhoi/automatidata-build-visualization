# Background on the Automatidata scenario
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles.

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day.
